# Tent_0-1_Image_Classification
Fine-tuned EfficientNetV2B0, for binary Image_Classification, with Gradio.

I only had 48 images of my tent, and I was wondering if that would be enough to fine-tune EfficientNetV2B0, after augmenting the data slightly. I decided to do it using cv2 for fun. 

There are 2 labels: **Tent, NonTent**. Their ratio is almost 50/50. Number of images after data augmentation:
1. **Train** data size: **504 files**
2. **Valid** data size: **112 files**
3. **Test** data size: **12 files**

You can learn from this code how to:

1. **Augment the data** with cv2
2. **Prepare the data** for the model
3. Quickly **fine-tune the mode**
4. **Use Gradio**

**Conclusions:**
This fine-tuned model was trained exclusively on images of my white MSR Hubba Hubba NX tent. Although one of the classes that the model was pretrained on was 'mountain tent', I further trained it to recognize tents in a variety of images, including augmented ones. As a result, the model gained the ability to recognize a tent even in cropped and rotated pictures. The pre-trained model doesnâ€™t possess this ability, and when presented with rotated images, it loses its wit and predicts odd things like parachutes or plastic bags. 

**Final utility**
This code enables any user visiting the site (new address is created by Gradio during each compilation.) to drag or upload any image (even strangly rotated) and get an evaluation of whether there is a tent somewhere in the image or not. The percentages given next to the label explain how confident the model is in its prediction.
